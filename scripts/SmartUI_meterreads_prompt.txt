I'm working on a complex SmartUI training simulation project for internal use at my company (Scottish Power). It visually mimics our actual customer systems using absolute-positioned HTML input fields layered over background images. It‚Äôs not interactive in a traditional web app sense ‚Äî rather, it simulates UI elements with pre-populated data for training purposes.

### üß© Current Focus: `meterreadsstored.html`

The specific page I‚Äôm working on is called `meterreadsstored.html`. This page is designed to show **historical smart meter reads** in a data table. Users can select one of three options:

- Show readings from the **last 7 days**
- Show readings from the **last 30 days**
- Enter a **custom date range** (start and end date)

This is all simulated ‚Äî no actual server connection or data fetching happens after load. All data is injected from static JSON via JavaScript and loaded into `localStorage`.

---

### üîß Key Files and Their Roles

#### 1. `meterreadsstored.html`  
- A static HTML page built around a background image with absolutely positioned input fields, radio buttons, and an empty data table.
- It displays the 7-day / 30-day / custom-date options, and a table of readings based on user selection.
- The user clicks an "Execute" image-button to trigger population of the data table.

#### 2. `smartui-loader.js`  
- This script runs on page load and is responsible for loading scenario data from a JSON file (in this case, `hiroshi.json`) into `localStorage`.
- It **does not simply copy the data** ‚Äî it enhances it.
- One of the enhancements is the creation of a new array in `localStorage` called `storedMeterReads`.

##### How `storedMeterReads` is created:
- `hiroshi.json` contains raw smart meter data (likely under a different name like `meterReads`), each item containing:
  - An `offset` value (i.e., how many days ago the reading occurred)
  - Register readings (`register1`, `register2`, etc.)
  - Total and average values
- `smartui-loader.js` converts the `offset` into a real **formatted date string** (e.g. `"2025-04-01"`) and stores this in a new `.date` field.
- The processed records are then saved as an array called `storedMeterReads` in `localStorage`.

‚úÖ This part **is working correctly**. When inspecting `localStorage`, the array appears with correctly formatted `.date` fields.

#### 3. `storedreads-loader.js`  
- This is the page-specific loader for `meterreadsstored.html`.
- It reads the `storedMeterReads` array from `localStorage`.
- It then filters and displays records in the table based on which radio button is selected.
- Filtering is currently done **using the `.offset` field**, not `.date`.

‚ùå This is the part we need to change ‚Äî we want to stop using `offset` entirely and transition to using the `.date` field instead, for all three cases:
1. 7-day filtering  
2. 30-day filtering  
3. Custom date range selection

#### 4. `hiroshi.json`  
- A static scenario JSON file loaded at the beginning of the simulation.
- It does **not** contain a `storedMeterReads` array.
- It contains raw data that includes `.offset` values.
- `smartui-loader.js` processes this raw data to create `storedMeterReads` in `localStorage`.

#### 5. `styles.css`  
- Handles the absolute positioning of fields and table styling.
- No current issues here. This file is working as intended.

### ‚úÖ What Is Working

- The 7-day and 30-day filters work using `.offset` filtering logic.
- The Execute button correctly populates the table when either is selected.
- The custom date fields are visually in place.
- `smartui-loader.js` successfully creates the `storedMeterReads` array in `localStorage`, and each record includes a properly formatted `.date` string derived from its `.offset`.

---

### ‚ùå What Is Not Working

- We have not succeeded in **switching filtering logic from `.offset` to `.date`** inside `storedreads-loader.js`.
- The **custom date range** filter does not currently function. It was built to filter by `.date` but is not working correctly.
- We have attempted to update the 7-day and 30-day filters to use `.date` instead of `.offset`, but all attempts have either failed or broken the existing functionality.
- We are stuck on the transition from offset logic to date logic.

### üß† Development Principles and Approach

This project is complex and very sensitive to errors. We are:

- Taking a **slow and methodical approach** ‚Äî not rushing anything.
- Reverting to working backups if something breaks.
- Prioritising **clarity** and **separation of responsibility** in code.
- Avoiding large-scale rewrites or speculative logic.
- Tracking all changes with backups named and dated.

### ‚ùì What We Need Help With

We need help carefully transitioning the filtering logic in `storedreads-loader.js` so that:

1. All three modes (7-day, 30-day, custom) filter using the `.date` field, not `.offset`.
2. `.offset` can then be deprecated from this section entirely.
3. Functionality for the custom date range section starts working correctly.
4. The 7-day and 30-day filters still behave the same but are now based on comparing `.date` values to `today`.

The `.date` field is formatted as `"YYYY-MM-DD"` and generated correctly. It‚Äôs just the filtering logic in `storedreads-loader.js` that needs to be reworked step by step.

Please help fix this part **carefully and incrementally**, making sure we do not break any current functionality. We‚Äôre happy to test one suggestion at a time and revert if necessary.
